# Diabetes prediction

## Background

Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent chronic disease that significantly impacts global health. It arises when the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. This results in elevated glucose levels in the blood, which can lead to long-term damage to various organs and tissues. Early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for preventing these severe outcomes.

The application of machine learning (ML) in healthcare has shown promising results in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, personalizing treatment, and improving patient outcomes. Specifically, ML techniques have been widely used to predict diabetes efficiently. Historical data from academic studies reveal that machine learning models can analyze complex datasets and identify patterns that might not be evident to human observers. For instance, researchers have employed algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks to predict diabetes onset with high accuracy based on risk factors such as age, weight, and genetic history (Kavakiotis et al., 2017; Maniruzzaman et al., 2018).

This project builds on the foundation of these previous works, aiming to leverage demographic and health-related data to predict the likelihood of diabetes using sophisticated machine learning techniques. By integrating diverse features, such as BMI, blood glucose levels, and hypertension status, this project seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis that could aid in early diagnosis and better management of diabetes.

## Data Description

| Feature             | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **gender**          | Gender refers to the biological sex of the individual, which can impact their susceptibility to diabetes. Categories include male, female, and other. |
| **age**             | Age is a significant factor as diabetes is more commonly diagnosed in older adults. Age ranges from 0 to 80 years in our dataset. |
| **hypertension**    | Hypertension is a condition where blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. It is coded as 0 (no hypertension) or 1 (has hypertension). |
| **heart_disease**   | Heart disease is linked with an increased risk of developing diabetes. It is coded as 0 (no heart disease) or 1 (has heart disease). |
| **smoking_history** | Smoking history is considered a risk factor for diabetes. Categories in our dataset include not current, former, no info, current, never, and ever. |
| **bmi**             | Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on weight and height. The range in our dataset is from 10.16 to 71.55. Categories are underweight (<18.5), normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), and obese (â‰¥30). |
| **HbA1c_level**     | Hemoglobin A1c level measures average blood glucose over 2-3 months. Higher levels (>6.5%) indicate a greater risk of diabetes. |
| **blood_glucose_level** | Blood glucose level measures the amount of glucose in the blood at a given time. High levels are a primary indicator of diabetes. |
| **diabetes**        | Diabetes is the target variable, with 1 indicating the presence of diabetes and 0 indicating its absence. |

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of each individual's health status and lifestyle, making it a robust basis for predicting diabetes through machine learning models.
